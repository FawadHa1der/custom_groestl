This repo contains the a modified and parallelized for both desktop and NVidia GPU C implementation for the
Groestl-256 hash function. 

The Q transformation can be parallelized(since it is not chained) so first we transform the whole input message using the Q transformation only and then we use 8 parallel threads to apply the P transformation.

Desktop version : hash.c
GPU Version: hash.cu  (Cudafied)
