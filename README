This repo is a bitsliced implementation of groestl. This repo is constant WIP for optimizations but the basic structure  is functional. This can be changed into a constant time implementation relatively easily with a small performance hit.

The input should be a large array which can be divided into N chunks. N chunks are then hashed parallel (64 hashes at a time, contingent register/word length).

Some code has been borrowed from https://github.com/conorpp/bitsliced-aes. SBox and GF(2^8) multiplication circuits borrowed from http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/peralta/CircuitStuff/CMT.html. Though multiplication circuis have been simplified/modified for constant multiplication
Thanks to Dr Rene Peralta.
