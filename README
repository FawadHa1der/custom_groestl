This repo is a bitsliced implementation of groestl. This repo is constant WIP for optimizations but the basic structure  is functional.

The input should be a large array which can be divided into N chunks. N chunks are then hashed parallel (64 hashes at a time, contingent register/word length).

Code has been borrowed from https://github.com/conorpp/bitsliced-aes particularly the SBOX impl. Many thanks to the author @conorpp.
Significant portions of it is new/custom per groestl specification.
